Large 8vo.(10.2 x 7.8 inches). Illustrated with 96 plates. Publishers original green cloth binding with gilt lettering and ruling to spine. Binding a bit rubbed and bumped but overall sound and the gilt still bright.     This copy has a full page original ink self portrait of Orpen on the front blank endpaper, showing the artist painting the famous American Wall Street lawyer and art collector, Paul Cravath. ---- The drawing is inscribed by Orpen at the bottom of the page ""My very dear Mr Cravath-It was a big job to tackle on those hot summer afternoons you must admit. All good wishes in 1922.-------(?)  William Orpen"". The drawing shows Cravath, a large man who stood 6ft 4inches, sat posing while a much smaller Orpen, the heat rising from his head and his sleeves rolled up, paints the portrait.   The book has the bookplate of the prolific author and traveller Cecil Roberts who has written a note on the blank verso of the frontis piece about Cravath and how he commissioned Orpen to paint his portrait, for a sum of £5000 plus expenses. While staying with Cravath at his Regency Long Island home, where the portrait was painted, Orpen gave Cravath this book as a memento. After Cravath died (in 1940) the house, and presumably some of the contents, was bought by Baron Eugene de Rothschild (in 1942) and Roberts notes that he was often his guest there. He doesn't explain how the book came to be his. There is one more note from Roberts, under the portrait of Lord Riddell (plate XLIX) mentioning his being at a press dinner given for him in 1919.     Aside from being third in charge, and legal advisor, of the American War Mission during the Inter-allied War Conference of 1917, the first American mission to a European council in history, Paul Cravath is mainly known for his ""Cravath System"" which transformed the way law firms work and is still in use today. The ""Cravath system"" included hiring new law school graduates, then training them within the firm as associates, and eventually inviting the best to become  partners. Throughout the twentieth century most of the growth of the big law firms relied on this system of recruiting, internal training, and loyalty to the firm.     A nice self portrait of the Artist at work, all the better for being within a copy of Orpen's fascinating war memoir.:",,,,,,,,"Art & Architecture Books | Illustrated books. | Irish books, Authors & Illustrators. | Signed & Inscribed Books",,,n,y,y,,,,,,https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/6614.jpg | https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/6614-2.jpg | https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/6614-3.jpg | https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/6614-4.jpg,For Sale,1,1,0.0000,0.00,,n,4500.00,4500.00,0,0.00,1,,0,0,0,0,2013-03-08 10:21:07,2013-03-08 10:21:07,2025-08-16 03:11:52

After telling the story of how the white cover came about and how he had refused to ever supply artwork for the publishers again, Bestall got this copy from his shelf and signed it for his guest, commenting as he did, that he had signed no other copy.

Reviewing one of her Leicester Galleries exhibitions in a 1938 edition of the Spectator, Symons wrote; 'Her profound sense of pure form in sculpture, heedless alike of realism and of exaggerated abstraction, is united with the subtlest delicacy of modelling, and these qualities combine to endow her bronzes with an abnormal power, an almost uncanny life, which only the sculpture of the greatest civilisations of the past has been able to produce.' Also a collector of her work, Symons and his wife bequeathed Gordine's 'A Malay Sultana' to the Tate Collection.",,,,,,,,AA Signed | Signed & Inscribed Books | The United Kingdom and Ireland. | Travel & Exploration books.,,,n,y,n,,,,,,https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/8545.jpg | https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/8545-2.jpg,For Sale,1,1,0.0000,0.00,,n,175.00,175.00,0,0.00,1,,0,0,0,0,2013-03-08 10:21:07,2013-03-08 10:21:07,2025-10-12 16:25:20

9162,9162,,CHANNING. WILLIAM E(llery).,,"SLAVERY. From the Boston (U.S.) second edition, revised by the Author.",,,James Hedderwick & Son. Glasgow. 1836,1836,,,,,,"FIRST BRITISH EDITION. 1st impression. 8vo. (7.1 x 4.4 inches). 172pp, i (publishers advert). A very good, uncut copy in the publishers brown morocco grained cloth with printed paper label to the spine. Several gatherings unopened. A little chipping to the label but overall a very good clean copy of this uncommon First UK edition. --------- Channing (1780-1842) initially held a common American belief about the inferiority of African people and slaves and felt that that once freed, they would need overseers. The overseers (largely former slave masters) were necessary because the slaves would lapse into laziness. Furthermore, he did not join the abolitionist movement because he did not agree with their way of conducting themselves, and he felt that voluntary associations limited a person's autonomy. Therefore, he often chose to remain separate from organisations and reform movements. This middle position characterised his attitude about most questions, although his eloquence and strong influence on the religious world incurred the enmity of many extremists. Channing had an enormous influence over the religious (and social) life of New England, and America, in the nineteenth century. Towards the end of his life Channing embraced immediate abolitionism. His evolving view of abolitionism was fostered by the success of British abolition in the British West Indies in 1834 and the lack of the expected social and economic upheaval in the post-emancipated Caribbean.",,,,,,,,"America | Economics and Politics books. | Natural History & Science books, includng social and political. | Original boards",,,n,n,y,,,,,,https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/9162.jpg | https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/9162-2.jpg,,1,1,0.0000,0.00,,n,150.00,150.00,0,0.00,1,,0,0,0,0,2015-02-13 08:49:03,2015-02-13 08:49:03,2024-08-22 13:38:45

Brassaï, who photographed much of Picasso's work in the 1940s, had published Conversations with Picasso in 1964, in which he created an intimate portrait of Picasso, covering their friendship and artistic collaboration, and recording each of their meetings with minute detail. Picasso said of the volume, ""Read this book if you want to understand me."" This account is written in a similar style, and during the course of the afternoon, Picasso speaks about his nostalgia for his old studios, his health, his enthusiasm for the recently invented felt-tip pen, his opinion of his own writings, his relationship with his wife Jacqueline, and his views on feminism.

Dent & Sons Limited. London. No date. Circa 1919,1919,,,,,,"EARLY EDITION. 8vo. (7.2 x 5.3 inches). 128pp. Illustrated with 8 fine colour plates, plus 7 line drawings (chapter headpieces), and decorative title page by Cole and Anning Bell. A very good bright copy in the publishers green cloth biding with elaborate gilt decoration and lettering to the front board and spine. Colour illustration mounted onto the front board. Some minor offsetting to the blank endpapers from the dustwrapper and a small amount of bleed from the green dye used on the top edge of the text block to the very top of a few leaves, otherwise a lovely clean copy throughout. In the original dustwrapper with a colour plate mounted to the front panel. A few minor chips to the wrapper edges but generally a very good example. ---- The book is not dated but the adverts on the wrapper suggest a publication date of about 1919 and there is also a publishers advert slip loosely inserted which has the date 9.1919 at the bottom.  ----- Attractive bookplate of Ilse Schneider to the front paste down. Ilse Rosenthal-Schneider (25 April 1891 – 6 February 1990) was a German-Australian physicist and philosopher. She is best known for her collaboration and correspondence with physicists Albert Einstein, Max von Laue, and Max Planck. Rosenthal-Schneider earned a PhD in philosophy in 1920 at the University of Berlin, where she first met Albert Einstein. After leaving Nazi Germany and emigrating to Australia in 1938, she became a tutor in the German department at the University of Sydney in 1945 and taught history and philosophy of science. In the 1940s and 1950s, she exchanged a series of letters with Albert Einstein about philosophical aspects of physics, such as theory of relativity, fundamental constants and physical reality. She remained in contact with Einstein through correspondence until his death in 1955.

Illustrated by twelve etchings executed by Louis Schiavonetti, from the original inventions of William Blake.",,,R. Ackermann. London. 1813 (Circa 1870?).,1813,,,,,,"PORTFOLIO OF 13 PLATES. No text, as issued. (Paper size 14.9 x 11.3 inches. The portfolio is 15.5 x 12 inches). Portrait of Blake, by T. Phillips, RA; Engraved title page (dated 1808) and 11 plates, all stating Ackermann as publisher, dated 1813 and engraved by Louis Schiavonetti, after Blake's designs. The pages have a little bumping to the edges but well away form the engraved area. Plates a little dusty and toned but the impressions are good. The original portfolio is brown Morocco grained cloth with elaborate blind tooled designs to both boards. Gilt lettering to the front board. Only one small piece of one silk tie remaining. Yellow coated endpapers. 3 small clippings from bookseller catalogues, each listing copies of the Blair/Blake book, tipped in to the front pastedown endpaper. Some minor rubbing and bumping to the cloth but the gilt is still very bright and the cloth clean. Overall a very good example of this rare edition. ----- ""When Gilchrist's Life of William Blake (1863) made the artist's name familiar again, a deposit of prints left over from 1813 came to light, probably in Ackermann's storehouse. Somebody (possibly John Cameron Hotton) reissued the books... There are no new title pages, no dates or places indicated; but the bindings are in mid-Victorian style, and could not have been made in the first half-century."" [A Blake Dictionary: The Ideas and Symbols of William Blake By Samuel Foster Damon]. ---- ""My theory on that is that Camden Hotten, who produced the 1870 issues, not only got the copperplates from Ackermann (with the Spanish inscriptions for de Mora) but also some remainders of the impressions and letterpress and bound these up in a slightly different fashion. He removed the Spanish on the coppers and had an engraver restore the 1813 English inscriptions, then printed for both the portfolio and the 1870 issue of the text with the engravings.""--(Essick).",,,,,,,,Art & Architecture Books | August sale. 2025 | Illustrated books. | Poetry and Plays. | The Romantics,,,n,n,n,,,,,,https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/10325.jpg | https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/10325-2.jpg | https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/10325-3.jpg | https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/10325-4.jpg | https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/10325-5.jpg | https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/10325-6.jpg | https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/10325-7.jpg | https://www.paulfosterbooks.com/pictures/10325-8.jpg,,1,1,0.0000,0.00,,n,1000.00,1000.00,0,0.00,1,,0,0,0,0,2023-12-04 09:23:09,2023-12-04 09:23:08,2025-10-30 09:28:11

Two neat previous owner names on front blank endpaper; 'Mary (Fl ?)avel her book. : 1769. and Maria Gresley, August 18th 1840'. ---- An important early feminist utopian novel. The most famous work of Sarah Scott (1720-1795), 'Millenium Hall' describes a female utopia, free from male violence, where property is held in common and a community of women conduct lives devoted to artistic pursuits and education, Christian virtues, and philanthropy. Through its focus on female equality, education and friendship, and with the Hall forming a model of mid-century reform ideas, it provided a fictional embodiment of the ideals of the Blue Stockings Society, of which Scott was a member and of which her sister, Elizabeth Montagu, was leader. A successful work in its time, it went through four editions by 1778, and in recent years has undergone a resurgence of scholarly and public interest, with a renewed focus on its early feminist meaning.

The anonymous publication of a poem titled ""Marriage"", in a Monthly Magazine issue during the summer of 1815, inspired Penn to organise The Matrimonial Society, which he established in early 1817 and which had for its object an improvement in the domestic life of married persons. It later extended its aims to include other schemes of domestic utility, and the society re-named itself the Outinian Society. During the summer of 1818 meetings of the society took place at Penn's house in London's Spring Gardens, and later at Stoke Park, Buckinghamshire, the family home purchased by his father in 1760. Penn, who acted as president, edited the works of the society for publication. The Second Lecture appeared in 1819, the General Address of the Outinian Lecturer in 1822, Records of the Origin and Proceedings of the Outinian Society in 1822, A Proposal of the Outinian Society in 1823 (written by Penn), and the Seventh Outinian Lecture in 1823.

Among the artists best and most imaginative works, this title is also one of the scarcest books that he illustrated. The humour in his verse is far surpassed by the comical imagination of the plates and shows the lighter side of Dulac's nature. The plates have all the decoration and style of those painted for the Arabian Nights and Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam but also have a sense of fun equal to that of William Heath Robinson.

11215,11215,,BAYNES. PAULINE. ( GRIMM. BROTHERS ).,,WATER COLOUR PAINTING OF HANSEL AND GRETEL. Illustration for Grimm's Fairy Tales.,,,Circa 1952,1952,,,,,,"ORIGINAL FULL COLOUR ARTWORK. The image shows Hansel and Gretel stood in front of the Witch, who is holding her broomstick and has her black cat on her shoulder. In the background is the beautiful house covered in biscuits, cakes, sweets & icing. The painting is signed by Baynes in the bottom left corner. Image size is 9.2 x 7 inches. Mounted to give a total size of 16.1 x 13.5 inches. The reverse of the painting has Baynes' agents stamp in black ink. Framed and glazed in attractive maple frame. --- A beautiful painting by one of the great twentieth century book illustrators, best known for her work on C. S. Lewis' Narnia series and J. R. R Tolkien's Tom Bombadil, Farmer Giles of Ham and Smith of Wooton Major. --- Through a contact I had who knew Pauline Baynes I sent a copy of this painting to her shortly before she died to see if she could supply any more information. All she could remember was that she had painted it for the publishers Blackie in about 1949 or 1950 as part of a series of watercolours they commissioned for an edition of Grimm's fairy tales that was intended to be issued in the early 1950's. Despite intensive searches for some years I have not been able to find a copy of that 1950's edition either for sale or listed in a library and think it may never have been published in its fully illustrated form. I have seen a copy of a 1960's edition with only one full colour plate, Snow White, as the frontispiece. Other scenes painted by Baynes from Grimm stories illustrate the dustwrapper but not this image and Baynes is not credited as illustrator in the book or dustwrapper.

Half title has ""IF"" printed in green within an ornamental black panel, the same printed onto the front board, but in red, with the addition of the author's name.

The Publishers note on page 5 appears in four different variants, with priority unknown, and this copy has variant iii.   An attractive copy of this uncommon little book. Published (probably November 1910) very shortly after the Poem first appeared in the book Rewards and Fairies (October 1910), this separate publication was issued to capitalise on the huge, and instant, popularity of what has become Kipling's most enduring work of verse. A poll taken by the BBC in the UK in 2005 voted it as Britain's favourite Poem, poling twice as many votes as the number 2 choice, Lord Tennyson's The Lady of Shallot. Originally written in 1895, IF was inspired by the actions of Dr. Leander Starr Jameson, a British Officer whose forces were defeated by the Boers in 1895, but who was portrayed as a victorious hero by the British press, the poem is a powerful masterclass in maintaining the British stiff upper lip.   --- David Alan Richards; Rudyard Kipling.
